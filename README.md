## How to run
Best way to run is to download Intellij and run the main function. 
By default, a static set of scenarios will be run and the results output to the console.
the following dataset is what is run by default:

```    
    10
    -
    -+
    +-
    +++
    --+-
    --++-+
    ++--+-
    ------
    ++++-
    --+++--
```


The program can be modified directly in the main class to test different cases.
Alternatively, a path to a text file formatted the same as above can be placed as the first program argument.
You can also create an executable jar using the `kotlinc` command and it should work the same way.
